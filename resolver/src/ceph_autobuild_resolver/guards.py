"""Edit-scope enforcement.

Per the spec: edits to upstream Ceph source files (anything outside ``debian/``)
must be expressed as new or modified entries under ``debian/patches/``. The
guard rejects direct mutations to upstream source paths so that all
behavioural changes are reviewable as discrete patches and stay compatible
with the existing quilt-based packaging workflow.

A second, softer guard *flags* (does not block) modifications to
``debian/control`` version constraints and removals from
``debian/patches/series`` — these go into the PR summary for explicit
reviewer attention.
