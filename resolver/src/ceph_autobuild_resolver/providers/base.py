"""Canonical types and the ``ProviderAdapter`` protocol.

WHY THIS LAYER EXISTS
=====================

Every LLM provider that supports "function calling" / "tool use" exposes the
same conceptual feature, but uses a slightly different wire format:

* OpenAI / OpenRouter use a list of ``tools`` with ``type: "function"`` and
  arguments returned as **JSON-encoded strings**.
* Google's Gemini uses ``function_declarations`` and returns arguments as
  already-parsed objects.
* Roles, tool-result attachment, and usage-counter field names all differ.

Rather than smear that conditional logic throughout the resolution loop, the
loop talks only to the *canonical* dataclasses defined here. A thin per-provider
adapter (``providers/openrouter.py``, ``providers/gemini.py``) is responsible
for translating between the canonical form and the wire form in both
directions. Adding a third provider is a new adapter file — nothing else
changes.

# In a chat-style LLM API a "conversation" is a list of messages, each tagged
# with a role: "system" (preamble / instructions), "user" (input we send),
# "model" (assistant reply), or "tool" (the *result* of a tool call we
# previously executed on behalf of the model). Tool calls flow as part of the
# model's reply; tool *results* flow back as their own messages so the model
# can read them on its next turn.
#
# We use the role name "model" internally (Gemini's term). The OpenRouter
# adapter rewrites it to "assistant" on the wire.

    ``args`` is **already deserialized** to a Python dict — the adapter is
    responsible for parsing the JSON string OpenAI-style providers return.
    Downstream code never has to remember which provider it's running against.
