"""Deterministic patch preflight: drop reversed patches, refresh drifted ones.

Two phases run before the model is ever invoked:

Phase 1 — Reversed patch detection:
  For each series entry, ``patch -F 0 -p1 --dry-run`` is run against a clean
  tree. "Reversed (or previously applied)" means the upstream already contains
  those changes; the entry and file are removed automatically.

Phase 2 — Drift auto-refresh:
  Surviving patches are walked with quilt. A patch that fails strict push
  (fuzz=0) but succeeds with fuzz=2 is correct in intent but has drifted line
  numbers. ``quilt refresh`` regenerates it with current context so dpkg-source
  will accept it without human intervention.
